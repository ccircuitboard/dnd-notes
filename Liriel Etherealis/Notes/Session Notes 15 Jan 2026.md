- Ran into Merchants from Barovia while in the Market Square in [[Frostveil]] where I found a small tome on a pedestal that called to my Ayrd. On top of it, in Elven there was written "The Book of Men and Elves" and it has no author. The pages were silk-like, the writing was stitched into it rather than actually written. The entire book is in Elven. It was a history book about a place, some Elven hold of some kind. It's written whimsically.
