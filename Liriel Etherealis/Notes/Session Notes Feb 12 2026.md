## Before clearing the Orc/Goblin camp
11 orcs 24 goblins 2 weird orcs scouted by Fiona
A bunch of prisoners, most are humans, half-elves, or elves
He changes some of them, transforms them. They call it "The Bathing". It is what they call "clean". 
Before the bathing they are regular orcs, only those worthy can be bathed. 
One other was put in a cage, fought them off for a long time, worth quite a lot.

## After clearing the Orc/Goblin camp
We cleared the Orc/Goblin camp. We freed many prisoners, one of them being the daughter of a Sultan in Ur. Among their possessions and the many items and riches we found there were documents and a map belonging to them. The map shows the following:

The documents read as follows:
*In elven*

"High greetings Vargun, Dream upon light and you shall find forgiveness for your sin of impurity, natures curse of death relieves itself in life, and for him who finds the tapestries of power shall reign in everlasting kinship at the top of the sloap of Marvelin, gold and women in hand. so keep sane and keep ready, produce many offspring, gold, and slave. bring them to the Home of the White sun and they shall provide for you resources and status, perhaps another meeting between the two of us. your master misses you, i have travelled much of our land and seen the camps, most impressive yet crude, i expect you to prepare to refurbish, remember, uruk may be uruk, but under he of light you are also elf, honorary, and in such you shall protray such beauty. death, in essense coats your camp, unfit of the boots i must wear in mortal essence, once of divinity, such places will be only for slaves. so live as masters.

Your one and only God."

*In elven*

"Vargun, provide the purest of blood feminine Elfs of all kintypes to me, collect them, regardless of value or beauty and i shall profligate the holy blood of light throughout the land through their loins. shall you provide such you shall bathe as such as your guards and wards. yet you shall be last, in most humbleness. Light itself is worth more then gold, and its power and radiance can seer a traitor, should you Fear Berthu's loyalty, send for it. and his scalp will peal in light as his skull fills with purity.

Your one and only God."
