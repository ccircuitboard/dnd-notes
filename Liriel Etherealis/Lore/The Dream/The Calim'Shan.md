A Calim'Shan is a dream protector, a dream Djinn. Those of significant importance in the dream are always protected by a Calim'Shan. The dream is an element, and the Calim'Shan and many others are spawn of it. The dream Djinn are an ethereal and secretive kind. Many of the ideas of what the Djinn are in the waking realm are due to the Dream Djinn's existence. They are a master of the elements and of aspiration. A blessing stowed upon them by their divine creation, they, like some of the others, have the ability to manifest change in one's life at a cost. But they are limited in many ways, just like all Djinn are, but dream Djinn especially. For their powerful nature may only manifest within The Dream. Outside of which, they are different, weaker. In the dream imagination are the same as reality. Calim'Shan are also trainers. Once one has control over the manifestation, one can gain control over all manifestation, even existence of the Dream itself.
