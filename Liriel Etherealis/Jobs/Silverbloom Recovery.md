**What:** Deep within the forest there is a tumor warping the weld. It is dangerous, prepare myself for it. It is no laughing matter. It is not innocent nor playful, nor is it humble and frail. It is dangerous. But, its corruption wreaths deeply within the trees. Many trees have forgotten their own names, and now are doomed by its cruelty. Should I deal with it, the stones, they may return to function within its lair. It is in the Misty Thicket, and it festers quietly within the mist. He will "sweeten the bark" with a cloak of Elvenkind. It could be very useful for me. The north is where the suffering lies. Deep within the thicket. Think much about your dreams and your thoughts and we can have a nice long talk about it all.

**Why:** It is my responsibility as Evergardian to save the forest I was raised in, and to cure the forests of Selacine.

**How:**
