**What** Goblins south-west of Lugwatch have been raiding the road to Solegarde

**Why:** We can’t have goblin tribes killing people on the roads, it’s the right thing to get rid of them.

**Method of Completion:** We killed all the Goblins in the camp because they were worshiping an evil God.

**Notes:** There was a totemic shrine to the Goblinkin God The Night Eye, The God of Schemes and Chaos. They are known for their mistreatment of their victims, including enslavement and abuse.
