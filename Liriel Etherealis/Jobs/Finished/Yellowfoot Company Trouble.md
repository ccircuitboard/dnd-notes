# Notes:
- Blue tiefling man named Pim knows about what’s happening but refuses to tell us
- Margaret Marigold acts suspicious and according to Brandenburgue’s husband/wife they are very suspicious and cunning
- In the granary, using Detect Magic we found a lockbox under some bags near the ladder. It has a coin symbol on it that was bleeding. (creepy as hell) The school of magic was Abjuration 
- Something ran through the fields and the tracks ran cold and into the forest
- Tiefling man was some sort of agent sent to protect Malcolm from danger
- Found note on Marigold by Rodrick Blackstone:

“Orders

-Track and find the treasure 

-Extract as much as you can out of them

-Kill malcome

Signed with an X and the Warden seal of Blackstone.”

- Got letter from “Modric Vane of Blackstone”

"Dear Liriel Etherialis and Fiona Night-Of-Lune

I am sorry to disturb the fairest of beauty and heart and soul who bares much in the width of motherhood upon the finest of wooded lands on this rainy morning. I have heard you were looking for my brother Sir Roderick Blackstone by his son, Roderick 2nd. I am informing you that I know of his current location and his detailing, should you wish to peruse. I am Captain Modric Vane founder of the Blackstone Company, a mercenary band whose reputation proceeds. and although it may proceed, I hope you will see sense and collaborate. In exchange I can offer much wealth. Although my company of mercenaries are not involved in his dealings, his hired hands or whatever he may espouse them to be, are going to be his undoing, I said as much to him in letter even.

In exchange for collaboration, I hope you would give good words for my title and efforts in the region. and of course, a moment of celebration, perhaps a dinner, together.~

Only of the finest vine Modric Vane of Blackstone. Blackstone Family Seal"

- We went to visit Modric Vane and he wishes for his honor back, and therefore wants to dishonor his brother who has dealings with not very good people. He apparently has a magically adept companion, “servant” Modric called it, who has been tracking us. I think it’s the person that we saw disappear in the fields. Regardless, Modric has given us Rodrick’s location and we plan to capture him.
- Rodrick has Kerralshwitz Lycanthropy, and is a reverse-Lycan. He actually seemed pretty cute, and apparently he has been committing his crimes to appease a kabal of evil Abbadon followers that seek to restore the “balance” on Ecrea. We managed to reunite him with Modric and he agreed to pay what he owed.
