**What:** Barbaugh the Innkeeper at the Walking Elk mentioned the dog at the nearby smith was experiencing “nightmares”, we went to help.

**Why:** As a Cleric of Dreams and a follower of the Goddess of Nightmares we figured it would fit our job description perfectly.

**Method of Completion:** I examined the dog’s dreams and figured out it was merely bothered by the loud noises coming from the anvil.
