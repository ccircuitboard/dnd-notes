# Notes:

House Drann of Hags Rest, a small noble family who owns stakes and businesses. She moves to Frostveil for education, and she met her partner. Their families don't get along for many reasons. The Heldenheim family has much influence in Ribenswald proper, in The Emerald Glade. More influence than Drann. The Drann family really doesn't like Heldenheim, and vice versa. 

Why Drann doesn't like Heldenheim:

- During The Extinguishing, Drann met with much harrassment from the Heldenheim family. The fey family of Drann hate that she is dating a human. They are denying her inheritance if they marry. Neither of them have had official work.

- Exchanged of letter between Marisa Heldenheim and her father from before, and during the war: her father had many opinions, and she shared some of them (which made Drann uncomfortable). They had a massive fortune they got on the backs of slaves, and vehemently opposed Amara. They bought a lot of mercenaries and conscripted slaves to help Riviona in the war. Try to look into the house of Heldenheim and Marisa and her house's past.
  
We solved this by getting her some Royal Dick. We may hit in the future if our relationship dynamic shifts.
