**What:** The Duchess is negotiating a new 1% tax on sales over 1000 gold. [[Lady Jinx Quickfoot]] and other nobles have banded together against this and refuse to cooperate. She is also fervently against an increase in guard in response to more “under the table” deals happening in [[Frostveil]].

**Why:** Completing this job will get us more influence and gold - also a possible attendance at a Hunt with the Duchess.

**How:** Sneaking into the manor to find incriminating evidence

# Notes: 
Write a report for the Duchess.

Vhalia followers in robes down the road.

Move goods from the warehouse to the storeroom out of town.

Gerembonds “Lady Evelyn” has been a pleasure to work with, she loves to rattle off secrets and interesting things from her family heritage. She has an inheritance and a quantity of wealth, old Gertrude were to trip and fall she could get the wealth.

Special Inquiry: Man was in contact with Lady Mezredine. She spoke about a mercenary from Err she hired to look into the situation. There were no survivors but a young scout, one of their recruits. They say they need anti-divination. She’s worried about what “it” could do if “it” found her. He wonders what he would say. “The old fool doesn’t even know how to manage anything. He’s more paranoid than he should be.”. She’s paying the Landsknechts to deal with it, expensively though. Worried what it would do to her if it found it. Jinx had not been sleeping well, hence why she hired the clerics of Vhalia. Whatever it is, it’s not from here. She says it was looking back into a storybook. It had a scream, a bellowing voice, which definitely puts fear in you.

The wharf section has the warehouse - increased guards and patrols. The goods there are illicit, and illegal, could implicate her. She wants to sell them to the Urrians. 

She threatened to remove the person who works for her’s tonsils and remove his voice.

Slavery is happening. “Urrians wouldn’t want them, since they don’t practice slavery.”

“He can cover for us”, regarding the queen. Reputation is important - he is an honorable hero who vouched for Jinx.

A foreigner rules, people are loyal to old rules, and even the old Baroness. 

Man called her “Crow Mother”. If it finds her, or if she finds her, that’s what she’s worried about. “Ultimately my hands are clean.” She says she hasn’t done anything wrong, she’s privy to the information.

Something cold is on the wind, haunting.

Man is long, tall tiefling, with an eye missing and a scar. He has a black eye with glowing purple iris. Long flowing black hair. Wears long flowing silver, purple, and black robes. He has earrings on, and a noble coat. Monocle over a scarred eye. His earrings are as if two c’s with a line. Spoke a dark guttural language. Sounded like Infernal. His name is Agrathir. He has a master, that could be in with “them”. Might be an extraplanar creature. Could be an immoral creature, that could hold grudges against others of its kind.

Another man is called Mesra, he has an orphanage. She wants the orphanage to get double food. There’s food shortages too. Threatened never to question the judgment of Jinx.

Common name under “Sir Ethermane Whispersilk”, about 8 different warehouses. The Whispersilks were criminals back in the day, the estranged second son of those legendary thieves. He is a business owner in the city. Multiple market stalls and the warehouses at the wharf, a fishing trade.

Agrathix changed his name after he went missing. He made a deal with something pretty evil, since then he’s been missing. 

The earrings are the symbol of morality. That symbol is him slashing the universe, the great existence in twine.
