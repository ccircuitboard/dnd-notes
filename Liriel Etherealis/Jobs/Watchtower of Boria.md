## Watchtower of Boria

What: Turning the old watchtower in the Misty Thicket, north of Frostveil into a chapel.

Why: I want to spread accessible healing services all across Selacine, it will be what I leave behind.

Steps:

- Talk to a Mason/Artisans Guild in Frostveil and take someone to the watchtower to see how much a renovation would cost  

Blueprint:

The IDEA is to create a community, rather than just one location. It won’t be cheap, but I’m willing to work as hard as possible to gain all the gold. The different parts of the blueprint of the area I have so far are:

- A general rebuilding of the watchtower into a chapel-like area where people can receive healing, and aid with any trouble concerning sleep, dreams, nightmares, etc. This contains an infirmary for people who need to stay and get medical attention.
    
- An inn on the side of the chapel for indulgences such as food, drink, socialization, and entertainment. 
    
- Sleeping quarters connected to both the Chapel and Inn that offer restful sleep and peaceful nights through magically enchanted beds using Boria’s holy magic. (I don’t know if this is possible but I will figure out a way.)
    
- A sanctuary in this piece of land, where not only kin can be safe, but also animals and beasts. Perhaps the sanctuary stone provides good dreams, or no dreams, depending on what the person wishes. A “dream sanctuary?”.
    

Plan:

Step 1: The Foundation

I got a quote from the suppliers in Frostveil that the start of the building would cost 50,000 gold. Something I can just about afford. Importantly I need a LARGE magical light that guides lost people to the site. 

  

Step 2: Securing before further development

I’ll go talk to the duchesses to secure a path/road that leads to the Chapel’s land. I’ll offer my services through adventuring or perhaps any healing they need to drive down the cost. If they need me to pay up front, then I’ll offer to work in the Marches in the south. 

  

Step 3: Further development/getting word out

In the city of Frostveil I’ll go to the main inn/tavern and treat people to free rounds of drinks and say it’s from The Dream Sanctuary in the edge of the forest, and that we offer healing, lodging, and a peaceful night’s rest to those who struggle to get it.
