After learning about The Elden Scrolls from the book [[Merinthian Atlendyr - Book of Men and Elves]]. I learned about Maeregor, a person who intended to look for one. He held very strong opinions about elf being superior to man, and I fear he might use its power for evil.

#### Steps
- [x] Go to Maeregor's spire south of Moonpoint
- [x] Get more information from Breanna about what she knows about the camp
- [x] Clear the logging camp of Orcs and Goblins
- [ ] Head to the northernmost point

#### Notes
- The tavern keeper said that the marchers spoke to her of an old spire between The Spire of Bralenor and Falcon Point.
- Possibly something related to Maeregor: Ran into Goblins and an Orc commander who mentioned forcing himself upon me and making his blood "pure". He mentions a "Master" and "One land one race one god above all else." Orc says the leader is Orgal, he is at Sylvyr(The Woodland North) which is the camp to the east on the hill.
