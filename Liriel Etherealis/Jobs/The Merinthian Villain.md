After learning about The Elden Scrolls from the book [[Merinthian Atlendyr - Book of Men and Elves]]. I learned about Maeregor, a person who intended to look for one. He held very strong opinions about elf being superior to man, and I fear he might use its power for evil.

#### Steps
- [] Go to Maeregor's spire south of Moonpoint
- 
#### Notes
- The tavern keeper said that the marchers spoke to her of an old spire between The Spire of Bralenor and Falcon Point.
